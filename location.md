      in the School of Education, Communication and Society at King’s College London.
      Ursula’s research interests are in academic literacy, English language policies
      and practices, and language teaching methodology. Ursula has developed and evaluated
      various genre-based approaches to teaching academic literacy in higher education.
      Her publications are concerned with the theoretical models underpinning literacy
      instruction, the impact of formative feedback on academic writing, and the teaching
      and learning of argumentation. In her recent book ‘Academic Literacy and Student
      Diversity: The Case for Inclusive Practice’, Ursula promotes a curriculum-embedded
      collaborative model of academic literacy instruction that is inclusive of students
