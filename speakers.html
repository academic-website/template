            <div class="bio"><p>Ursula Wingate is Senior Lecturer in Language in Education and works in the School of Education, Communication and Society at King’s College London. Ursula’s research interests are in academic literacy, English language policies and practices, and language teaching methodology. Ursula has developed and evaluated various genre-based approaches to teaching academic literacy in higher education. Her publications are concerned with the theoretical models underpinning literacy instruction, the impact of formative feedback on academic writing, and the teaching and learning of argumentation. In her recent book ‘Academic Literacy and Student Diversity: The Case for Inclusive Practice’, Ursula promotes a curriculum-embedded collaborative model of academic literacy instruction that is inclusive of students from all backgrounds.</p>

<p>Lucy has lead numerous strategic projects including large scale business change and technology projects particularly in university administrative and service areas.  She is very focused on creating value for customers – perhaps because of all those hospitality jobs when she was young. Added to this is her passion about the value and difference an education makes.</p>

<p>Lucy has worked in the higher education sector for a number of years in both academic and administrative positions, as well as in higher education regulation.  She has a number of qualifications including in Communication Studies, Legal Studies, Education, and Management Research.  She has also completed the Company Directors diploma and is a Fellow and Meritorious Service Award winner of the Association for Tertiary Education Management (ATEM).</p>
